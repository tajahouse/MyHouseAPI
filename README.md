# MyHouse API

This is the backend for the My House application, a family organization tool that helps parents manage their households.

## Get Started
To get started with the backend, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Open the project in your IDE of choice (we recommend using VSCode with the Spring Boot extension).
Make sure you have JDK 11 installed and set up on your machine.
Run the application using the mvn spring-boot:run command.
The backend should now be running on localhost:8080. You can test the API using an API testing tool like Postman.
